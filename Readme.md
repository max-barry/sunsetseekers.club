# SunsetSeekers.club
One day this will be a site about sunsets. Until then, it's just goofing around with blend modes and video.

[sunseekers.club](http://sunseekers.club)

All the text is live. There are pseudo elements with the bands over the text which combines with the blend mode to make something unorthodox.

```
h1 {
    font-size: 17vw;
    mix-blend-mode: overlay;
}
```

## Branches
`kitchen-sink` contains the entire original project including:
 - "Fullscreen to unlock" experience
 - Experimental narrative keyline effect
